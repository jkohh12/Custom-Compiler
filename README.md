**Compiler Name**: Panda-EXP

| Language Feature | Code Example |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Integer Scalar Variables | `i a; i b; i count;` |
| One dimensional array of integers | `arr[{100}] a; arr[{5}] b = [{}]; arr[{5}] numbers = [{1,2,3,4,5}];` |
| Assignment Statements | `a :=: b; count :=: numbers;` |
| Arithmetic operators (e.g., “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”) | `a + b; a - b; a &* b; a / b;` |
| Relational Operators (e.g., “<”, “==”, “>”, “!=”) | `a << b; a <-b; a >> b; a ?<- b;` |
| While Loop | `during {true} [{ a <- a-b;  }] ` |
| If-then-else | `whether {a<<b} [{ a <- a@b }] or [{ a <- a! b;}]` |
| Read and write statements | `input>{a}; output<{a};` |
| Comments | `… comment …` |
| Functions | `task{a, b} [{a <- a!b; rebound}]` |

Define how comments would look like in your language: … (comment) … <br />
Define what would be the valid identifier: Identifier must have characters [A-Z] and/or [a-z] and/or numbers [0-9], and/or underscore(\_)
Identifier must also start with a lower case character [a-z], while the rest of the characters can be [A-Z] and/or [a-z] and/or numbers [0-9], and/or underscore(\_) <br />
Whether your language is case sensitive or not: This language is case sensitive <br />
What would be white spaces in your language: White spaces are ignored in this language. <br />
